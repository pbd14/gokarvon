# Karvon — AI-powered booking platform for local services

## 1-sentence definition
**Karvon is a multi-category booking platform where customers can search, compare, book, and pay for local services in one place — while businesses manage availability, bookings, and customers in a single system (with built-in AI and marketing tools).**

---

## The problem Karvon solves

### Booking local services is still manual
In many markets, booking a restaurant table, a gaming club room, a sports venue, or a beauty service still looks like this:

- Customers have to **call, DM, and wait** (“are you free?”, “what times?”, “how much?”).
- Businesses manage bookings across **Telegram/Instagram chats, spreadsheets, notebooks, or memory**.

This creates hidden losses:
- **missed bookings** from slow replies,
- **double bookings** and human errors,
- no clean **customer history** or analytics,
- staff spend time “living in chats” instead of serving guests.

Karvon removes that friction with a single booking layer for both sides of the market.

Karvon is **one platform for clients and businesses**:

### For customers (Karvon app)
- Discover many services (restaurants, gaming clubs, sports venues, medicine, beauty, entertainment, and more)
- Compare places and options
- Book instantly and pay in one flow (no calls, no waiting)

### For businesses (Karvon Host)

## What Karvon AI is (and why it matters)
**Karvon AI is the chat-first booking and discovery layer for Karvon.** It lets customers find venues, ask questions, and **complete bookings inside chat** (starting with Telegram), while giving venues a **ready-to-deploy AI booking assistant** they can run as their own branded bot.

### Karvon AI is NOT “just a chatbot”
Karvon AI is execution-first:
- **Grounded in venue data** (services, prices, rules, hours, policies)
- Connected to a **structured booking engine** (availability, slot rules, add-ons, confirmations, reschedule/cancel)
- Built for **correctness and reliability**, with escalation when uncertain

### Why Karvon AI exists
In many markets, messaging is the default UI. Karvon AI turns bookings into **“just text it”** — and makes Karvon ready for a future where **other AI assistants book on behalf of users** (agent-to-agent bookings).

---

## How booking works (end-to-end)
1) **Partners provide data**: locations, services/resources, schedules, pricing, rules, policies  
2) Customers discover venues in Karvon (or via Biocard/QR/chat)  
3) Customer makes a booking request (app or chat)  
4) Karvon checks rules/availability and creates the booking request  
5) Partner **accepts or declines** in Karvon Host (or via integration)  
6) Customer gets confirmation  
7) Partner delivers the service  
8) Payment is handled either directly or through Karvon (depending on setup)

---

## Key capabilities for customers
- **One app, many categories**: book different services without switching platforms
- **Faster conversion**: fewer steps than calling/DMing multiple places
- **Trust and clarity**: structured booking details, clear confirmations
- **Chat booking option** with Karvon AI for users who prefer messaging

---

- Conflict prevention / fewer double bookings

### 2) Customer database + risk control

- Promotions and featured listings (as the platform grows)

### 4) AI automation (Karvon Sales AI Agent)
- Talks to customers in Telegram/Instagram
- Answers common questions
- Collects details and can complete bookings
- Acts like a 24/7 online manager (with safe escalation)

### 5) Works even if a business already has a system
If a partner already uses CRM/booking software, Karvon can be:
- an additional booking channel, or
- integrated via API (so partners don’t “replace everything”).

## Why Karvon is different

### Multi-vertical + marketplace dynamics
Most solutions are:
- manual status quo (calls/DMs/spreadsheets), or
- point tools (single vertical), or
- travel-heavy platforms (hotels/flights) that don’t cover everyday local services.

Karvon is a **multi-vertical** booking layer — built to create cross-category discovery (example pattern: “football at 8pm → restaurant at 10pm”).

### AI that executes, not just chats
Karvon AI is built around **correctness + booking execution**, not generic conversation.

---

## Traction (early proof)
- **50+ partners connected**
- **500+ MAU**
- **3 active cities**
- **12 service categories**
- **~70% reduction** in average time spent making bookings
- **~4 hours/day saved** for business operations (reported/estimated from partner usage)

---

## Business model (how Karvon makes money)
Karvon is built as a marketplace + SaaS platform:

1) **Commission / take-rate per completed booking**  
2) **Optional SaaS plans** for advanced partner features  
3) **Paid promotion / featured listings** inside search and discovery  

For Karvon AI specifically, a natural expansion is **B2B SaaS tiers** (channels, booking volume, resources, analytics, advanced automation), and later **API / agent-to-agent usage** pricing.

---

## Vision (where this goes)
Karvon’s long-term goal is to become the **default booking infrastructure for local services** in under-digitized markets — and eventually a global booking layer.

As AI adoption grows, Karvon AI can become the **standard booking endpoint** that other AI assistants use to execute real bookings reliably (agent-to-agent commerce).
